Concordance
===========

This program takes the input from standard input and print the concordance into
the standard output.


Build Instruction
=================

make

NOTE: This program needs a compiler with C++11 support. This has been tested on
Apple LLVM version 6.1.0


Usage
=====

cat sample.txt | ./concordance


Further Work
============

1. This program can be enhanced to do more complex pre-processing of the input
text, such word stemming and special charactors and terms (e.g., "It's" or an
URL) handling.

2. The splitting of a paragraph into sentences is based on the assumption that
a sentence ends at '.', '?' or '!'. However, this is not always true (e.g.,
"i.e. an alphabetical..."), and it can be addressed later.

3. If the input text is very big, this program can be changed to build the
index in multiple threads as followings.

    - split the input text into multiple sets of paragraphs
    - build the index for each set of paragraphs in a separate thread
    - merge the indices from multiple threads into a bigger index.

This can also be done in Map-Reduce in a distributed system if the input text
is super large.
